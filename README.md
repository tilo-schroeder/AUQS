# AUQS = Absolutely Useless Quantum Simulator
This is a direct port from [this](https://github.com/adamisntdead/QuSimPy) python project by [Adam Kelly](https://github.com/adamisntdead) in Go for now. I plan to expand this to be more go-like with regards to structure and interface. It will never turn out to be something useful but will always stay a project to just get some insights about quantum computing and the Go programming language.

# TODO
- [] Refactor the auqs.go file to be a small entry point and move the rest into an appropriate structure
- [] Move on from deprecated seed.Rand
- [] Change the way that circuits are defined to be more readable
